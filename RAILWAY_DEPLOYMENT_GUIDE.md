# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide - ProCV Chat Server

Deploy your ProCV chat server to Railway cloud platform in under 10 minutes!

## üéØ What You'll Deploy

- ‚úÖ **Production WebSocket Server** - Real-time chat infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL Database** - Cloud database with backups
- ‚úÖ **Redis Cache** - Session management and caching
- ‚úÖ **Auto-scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically
- ‚úÖ **SSL/HTTPS** - Secure connections included
- ‚úÖ **Health Monitoring** - Built-in application monitoring

## üìã Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Railway account (free): https://railway.app
- ‚úÖ Git repository with ProCV code
- ‚úÖ Terminal/command line access

## üöÄ Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

```bash
# Option A: Using npm
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Option B: Using curl (if npm fails)
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2: Login to Railway

```bash
railway login
```

### Step 3: Deploy with Our Script

```bash
cd property-cv/chat-server
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh --platform railway
```

**That's it!** üéâ The script will:
- ‚úÖ Validate your code
- ‚úÖ Create Railway project
- ‚úÖ Add PostgreSQL and Redis
- ‚úÖ Set environment variables
- ‚úÖ Deploy your application
- ‚úÖ Provide production URL

---

## üîß Option 2: Manual Deployment

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

```bash
cd property-cv/chat-server
railway init
```

Choose: **"Empty Project"**

### Step 2: Add Database Services

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL database
railway add postgresql

# Add Redis cache
railway add redis
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Core configuration
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=8080

# Security (generate strong JWT secret)
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# CORS (update with your domain)
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.netlify.app,https://procv.cv

# Optional: Stripe configuration
railway variables set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_stripe_key_here
```

### Step 4: Deploy Application

```bash
railway up
```

### Step 5: Get Your Production URL

```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# Get the public URL
railway domain
```

---

## üîó Frontend Integration

### Update Frontend Environment

Once deployed, update your frontend environment variables:

```bash
# In property-cv/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_SERVER_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
```

### Test Connection

Test your WebSocket connection:

```javascript
// Test in browser console
const socket = io('https://your-app-name.up.railway.app', {
  auth: { token: 'test-token' }
});

socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('‚úÖ Connected to production chat server!');
});
```

---

## üîí Security Configuration

### Essential Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for production
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_here

# CORS protection
CORS_ORIGIN=https://procv.cv,https://your-domain.com

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000
WS_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_USER=5

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Generate Secure JWT Secret

```bash
# Generate a secure 64-character random string
openssl rand -base64 64

# Example output:
# k8hY2nP9vQ4mR7tA6sL3jH5fG8dS1wE9rU0yI2oK4vN7bM3zX6cQ1pL5tA8hY2nP
```

## üìä Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoint

Your deployed app includes health monitoring:

```bash
# Check application health
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-07-30T17:47:33.840Z",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "activeConnections": 0,
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### Metrics Endpoint

```bash
# Get application metrics
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/metrics

# Response includes:
# - Memory usage
# - Active connections
# - Database status
# - Redis status
```

### View Logs

```bash
# Real-time logs
railway logs --tail

# Filter by service
railway logs --service postgresql
railway logs --service redis
```

---

## üìà Scaling & Performance

### Auto-scaling Configuration

Railway automatically scales your application based on:
- **CPU usage** (scales up at 80% CPU)
- **Memory usage** (scales up at 80% memory)
- **Request volume** (adds instances for high traffic)

### Manual Scaling

```bash
# Scale to specific number of instances
railway up --replicas 3

# Scale based on resource limits
railway variables set RAILWAY_REPLICA_COUNT=2
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor your app in Railway dashboard:
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. View metrics:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Network traffic
   - Response times
